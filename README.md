## Documentation Scope

We have documented only the contents of the `/implementation` folder. The folders `/implementation_single_agent` and `/PDDL_implementation` were excluded from full documentation as they are structurally identical to `/implementation`, except for the additional multi_agent features included in the latter. However, parts of the `/PDDL_implementation` that are exclusive and not present in either `/implementation` or `/implementation_single_agent` were documented accordingly (src/libs/PDDL/pddlExecutor.ts).

`/implementation` also has html docs. Run `npm run docs` to generate html docs inside the `/docs` folder
